The Voice Assistant project is a Python application created as part of the OIBSIP internship at Oasis Infobyte. It utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with users through voice commands. The assistant can perform basic tasks such as responding to queries, opening applications, and fetching information. This project helped in understanding automation, user interaction, and integration of external libraries, making it a practical example of real-world Python applications
